# content-patterns
a repository for content patterns in use across the National Lottery Heritage Fund digital services, so that we can use the same consistent, plain, accessible language everywhere


We're documenting our patterns in a [wiki within this repository](https://github.com/heritagefund/content-patterns/wiki)
